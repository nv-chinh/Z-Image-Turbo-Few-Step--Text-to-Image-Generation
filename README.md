# Z-Image Turbo: Few‑Step Text‑to‑Image Generation

## Overview

**Z-Image Turbo** is a fast **text-to-image diffusion inference project** built on top of the Z-Image architecture. It focuses on generating high-quality images using **only a few denoising steps** to reduce inference latency, making it suitable for interactive applications and large-scale deployment.

This repository focuses on inference usage only — how to run Z‑Image Turbo for text‑to‑image generation, and how its internal pipeline works.

## Model Pipeline

Below is the end‑to‑end pipeline for text‑to‑image inference using Z‑Image Turbo:
```text
Text Prompt
   ↓
Text Encoder (Qwen3-4B)
   ↓
Text Embeddings
   ↓
Gaussian Noise Latents (z_T)
   ↓
Few-Step Diffusion Transformer (Z-Image Turbo)
   ↓
Denoised Latents (z_0)
   ↓
VAE Decoder (Flux VAE)
   ↓
Final RGB Image

```

### Denoising Process

- The model starts from **Gaussian noise** in latent space  
- At each step, the diffusion model predicts a **noise residual**  
- The scheduler updates the latent state using this prediction  
- Thanks to few-step distillation, **each step performs a large, deterministic denoising jump**
